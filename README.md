Tap Option is an innovative, gamified trading platform that blends the excitement of competition with options trading. Participants begin each tournament with a virtual balance of $100, allowing them to test their skills in a risk-free environment.

The leaderboard tracks each trader's performance throughout the tournament, providing real-time rankings. Traders can sign up to join existing tournaments or create their own, inviting others to compete for the top spot.

To keep the competition fierce, participants have the option to refill their tournament balance if it becomes depleted, ensuring they remain in the game. At the end of the tournament, the top ranking traders are rewarded based on their overall performance (closing balance). Whether you're a seasoned trader or a newcomer looking to sharpen your skills, Tap Option offers an engaging and competitive experience for all.
